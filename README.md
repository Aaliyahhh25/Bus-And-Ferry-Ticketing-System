# Bus And Ferry Ticketing System

Currently in Progress. I uploaded the first very simple activity after I learned if-else statement for the first time. As a 4th year IT Student, I can say that this is a very stupid code because it is not efficient and it is very long and redundant. Since that was my first try in programming and that code was created before learning OOP and switch case so the only thing I used

So I would like to re-do this code and make it efficent compared to the original

status: I will start this project after I finish my POS(point of sale) system using Java . The files that are uploaded here is still the long (original) one. Thank You.
